## About

`codealpha_Hangman` is a console / GUI / web-based implementation of the classic Hangman word-guessing game. You can guess letters, track attempts, and get feedback until you either guess the word or run out of tries.

This project is intended for learning, demonstration, and fun challenges.

## Features

- Random word selection  
- Letter-by-letter guessing  
- Tracking remaining lives / attempts  
- Display of partially guessed word state  
- Optionally: hints, difficulty levels, high scores, save/load  

## Tech Stack

- Language: **Python** (or whichever you use)  
- Dependencies: (if any) e.g. `rich` for nice console output, `tkinter` for GUI  
- Word source: local word list / dictionary file  
- Optional: testing framework (pytest / unittest)
